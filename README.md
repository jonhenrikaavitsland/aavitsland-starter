# This is a environment set up for my future projects

## Important note:

- create the gitignore file from template before using npm i
- move the workflow folder into a .github folder
- you can drag all the folders and files into your project root and replace current package.json

``` npm i ```


### Note to self

```
husky - DEPRECATED

Please remove the following lines from your hook scripts:

#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

They WILL FAIL in v10.0.0
